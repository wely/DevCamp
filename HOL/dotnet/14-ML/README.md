# Machine Learning

In this lab, you will extend the City, Power, and Lights (CPL) application to leverage Machine Learning. Exercises 1-3 can be completed without the working City, Power, and Lights application. In these exercises, we will use real world data from New York City's Department of Transportation to create a model predicting how long a repair will take, publish this model as a web service, and then use this web service in the application to show the user a reasonable estimation for time to repair.

Machine Learning Studio supports many types of predictive models capable of regression, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. Choosing a model type for a given real world prediction can be very difficult: data scientists often test multiple model types against their data to see which performs the best. Frequently, the best results are obtained by combining multiple models of different types together. While a full inventory and examination of the (growing) model types supported by Azure Machine Learning Studio is beyond the scope of this exercise, a good starting place to learn more would be the Azure Machine Learning Studio Cheat Sheet poster: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-cheat-sheet, or the more detailed documentation available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-choice.

For our exercise, we will use a Neural Network Regression model. We will use a "Regression" model (as opposed to classification, clustering, or anomaly detection) as we are trying to predict how long a repair will take. Our goal will be to product a model that, given information about the complaint such as "Complaint Type", when the complaint was reported, and the location of the incident, will return a single value indicating how long the model predicts the repair will take, based on training data we will supply.

We will leverage a "Neural Network" as it is a good generic model type to use when you do not know much about the underlying data or its patterns. While they Neural Networks are amongst the slowest and resource-intensive models to train, they are extremely well-suited to identifying and expressing very complicated patterns to a high degree of accuracy. In fact, a major drawback of Neural Networks is that their models are almost impossible to be interpreted by a human once they have been created, unlike other model types such as decision trees.

![Neural Network identifying a complex pattern](media/50/intro_nnpattern.png)

Neural Networks originated at the intersection of neuroscience and early modern computing in the 1940s, and seek to replicate how neurons in animal brains operate. At its basic level, a single neuron (biological or computational) consists of a unit with 1-many inputs, and 1-many outputs, with each input assigned a weight. Each output is the sum-product of the inputs and their associated weights, usually after being processed through another function to simulate a threshold. A Neural Network is a collection of many neurons. By default, Azure Machine Learning Studio's Neural Network models use a single "hidden" layer with all neurons "fully connected". However, using Net# (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/azure-ml-netsharp-reference-guide), more complicated arrangements can be easily expressed, such as 2 layer models often used for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The default single-layer model is arranged similar to:

![Single Hidden Layer](media/50/intro_singlelayernn.png)

There are usually significantly more neurons in the "Hidden Layer" compared to the number of inputs. The "learning" is accomplished via iterations. At first, each neuron is given a starting (often random or uniform) set of weights for each input. A set of inputs with known outputs (training data) are provided, and for each of these, the Neural Network's expected output is computed and compared to the known output. Based on how "wrong" the neural network's prediction was compared to the known output, a mathematical function is applied to each weight, hopefully resulting in a slightly more accurate model. This new model's accuracy is then recomputed, and its weights adjusted. This process is repeated a number of times (configurable in Machine Learning Studio). If you specify too few iterations, the model is not sufficiently tuned and provides inaccurate results. However, too many iterations often results in an "over-trained" model in which the Neural Network identifies patterns present in the training data that don't necessarily work when applied to real world data. Creating the "training set" of known data, and also ensuring a sufficient "evaluation set" of data to test the model once it has been trained is a very important step in Machine Learning. See https://www.jefftk.com/p/detecting-tanks for a (possibly apocryphal) example of overtraining.

## Exercise 1: Configure Machine Learning Studio & Preparing our data

In this exercise, we will take a look at the data we will be using to train our model and open Azure Machine Learning Studio 

### Gather the data

1. Download the sample dataset from https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/DevCamp/blob/14mlinit/HOL/dotnet/14-ML/NY_complaints_to_DOT_CPL.csv, and open it in a text editor or preferably Excel. You'll see that it is a Comma Separated Value (CSV) formatted text file with linebreaks for each row, with column headers in the first row. This data was originally downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Street-Lights-and-Traffic-Signals-311-Service-Requ/jwvp-gyiq. Slight alterations have been made:

>> **NOTE on the data**

    * Since New York uses different categories of complaints than our City, Power,and Lights application, we have substituted CPL categories to allow us to use this model against CPL's application in Exercise 3. Example mappings used include: "Traffic Signal Condition" -> "Street light-Light Goes On and Off", "Highway Condition" => "Pot hole", and "Opinion for the Mayor" => "Gas leak"

    * We have extracted a few features (columns) in order to improve predictive quality, including "Duration_Days" ("Closed Date" - "Created Date"), as well as Year, Month, Day of Month, and Day of Week for "Created Date". If you desire an additional challenge at the end of the exercise, these features could be created in the Machine Learning Studio.

    * In order to ensure that you can generate a good model in a reasonable amount of time for this exercise, duration_days have been generated artificially. The algorithm used to generate the artificial durations was reasonably complex and included random noise to ensure realism- feel free to examine the data to see if you can locate any human-identifiable patterns (there shouldn't be any).

### Open Machine Learning Studio

1. Navigate to https://portal.azure.com and sign in. Click on "New", and search for "Machine Learning Studio Workspace"

    ![Creating a new Machine Learning Studio Workspace in the Azure Portal](media/100/ml1_mlw.png)

1. Click `Create`

    ![Create the Machine Learning Studio Workspace](media/50/ml1_mlwcreate.png)

1. Name your workspace `DevCamp_ML`, and add it to the existing DevCamp Resource Group. Choose the same location you've used previously. Create a new storage account `devcampmlstorage[ADD YOUR INTIALS AND THE DATE TO MAKE IT UNIQUE]`, and ensure that your workspace is in the "Standard" pricing Tier and your Web Service Plan is 1`S1`.

    ![Configuring the ML Studio Workspace](media/50/ml1_mlwcreate2.png)

### Launch Machine Learning Studio

1. Navigate to the DevCamp Resource Group, and select the newly created Machine Learning Studio Workspace, and then "Launch Machine Learning Studio".

    ![Launch ML Studio](media/50/ml1_mlwselect.png)
  
1. If you are not already signed in, sign in using the same credentials you used for the Azure Portal

    ![Sign In to ML Studio](media/50/ml1_signin.png)

1. If you have previously used Machine Learning Studio, make sure you are in the newly created "DevCamp_ML" workspace using the dropdown in the top-right corner. It should be empty.

    ![Verify Workspace](media/50/ml1_workspace.png)

### Upload our data set

1. Choose "Datasets" and click new, then upload our sample data "from a local file"

    ![Upload dataset](media/50/ml1_uploaddataset1.png)

    ![Name dataset](media/50/ml1_uploaddata.png)

----

## Exercise 2: Train a Data Model

In this exercise, we will use the data from Exercise 1 to train a neural network to estimate how long a repair will take

1. Create a new blank experiment in Machine Learning Studio

    ![Create a new experiment](media/50/ml2_blankexperiment.png)

1. Add the dataset to your workspace

In the toolbox, expand Saved Datasets -> My Datasets. You should see the data set uploaded in Exercise 1 (if not, check to see if it has completed uploading). Drag the dataset into your workspace

    ![Dataset in the workspace](media/50/ml2_dataset.png)

1. Remove rows with missing values. First, let's clean our data. For this sample, we will be fairly intolerant - we'll drop any row that has any missing values. Drag a "Clean Missing Data" module (Data Transformation -> Manipulation) into our workspace, and connect our dataset to its input. Configure it in the right taskpane as follows:

* All Columns
* Cleaning Mode: remove entire row

    ![Clean Missing Data](media/100/ml2_cleandata.png)

1. Partition our data into "Training" and "Evaluation" sets. We need to split our data into training data and evaluation data. The training data will be used by the neural network to create the model, but need to make sure we have some data "set aside" to allow us to evaluate the quality of our model before we use its predictions in production. Using the training data for evaluation can often result in "over-training", where a model provides excellent results against its input data, but fails to make accurate predictions when provided with new data. Our sample data contains information from 1/1/2014 through 9/13/17, so a natural split will be to separate all data before 6/1/17 as training, and the data afterwards as evaluation data. This gives us a good evaluation - we can pretend we used "all information available" in June 2017, and see how the model would have performed from June -> Sep 2017, and leaves enough data in the "training set" to identify long term annual and seasonal patterns. We'll do this in 2 steps: first by year, then by month. For the year split, drag a "Split Data" module (Data Transformation -> Sample & Split) into the workspace and connect it to our dataset. Configure it as follows:

* Mode = Relative Expression
* Relational expression = \"Created Year" < 2017

1. Since we're going to have multiple "Split Data" modules, let's add a comment so that we can keep track. Right click on the module, and choose "Edit Comment". Decorate it with "Year < 2017", and then expand the module so you can see the comment.

    ![Year Split](media/100/ml2_splityear.png)

1. The left output of the "Year Split" module will now contain our data from 2014 - 2016, and the right output data from just 2017.

1. Let's add another "Split Data" module to the right output and separate out Jan -> May and Jun+. Configure the new "Split Data" as follows:

* Mode = Relative Expression
* Relational expression = \"Created Month" < 7
* Edit Comment = Month < 7

    ![Month Split](media/100/ml2_splitmonth.png)

1. Now, our training data is separated into 2 buckets: 2014-2016 and Jan 2017-May 2017. Let's recombine them by adding an "Add Rows" module (Data Transformation->Manipulation). Connect the left output of the "Split Years" and the left output of the "Split Month" modules into the inputs of "Add Rows".

    ![Combine Training Data](media/50/ml2_combinetraining.png)

### Data Visualization

1. Let's take a quick testing checkpoint. Run your model using the bottom toolbar, and visualize the data coming out of the components we've added. Right click on the "Add Rows" module and choose `Results Dataset >Visualize`

    ![Visualize Data](media/50/ml2_visualizeaddrows.png)

1. Explore the various columns' statistics. Note that the frequency diagram for "Created_Year" has 3 roughly equal spikes (2014,2015,2016) and a shorter one for 2017. This makes sense, as we've truncated the 2017 data to Jan -> May

    ![Visualize Data](media/50/ml2_visualizeaddrows2.png)

1. Optionally, perform some quick spot checks, such as:

* The number of rows in the output of the "Add rows" module (our training sample) and the right output of "Split Months" (our evaluation sample) should equal the number of rows that went into the "Split Years" module.
* The evaluation sample should only have data from June 2017 - Sep 2017
* Make sure the "Duration Days" look clean - there should be no rows with Duration <= 0

### Shuffle

We have one final data preparation step. While visualizing the output of the training sample, you may have noticed that our data is sorted by Complaint_Type. Neural networks perform very poorly on ordered data, so we'll want to randomize our data before we use it. Let's use another "Split Data" module, configured as follows:

* Splitting Mode: Split Rows
* Fraction of rows: 0.999
* Randomized Split: checked
* Random seed: Pick a number
* Stratified Split: False
* Edit Comment: Shuffle

    ![Shuffle Data](media/100/ml2_shuffle.png)

### Modeling

We are now ready for the main part of this exercise: the modeling! Drag in a "Neural Network Regression" module (Machine Learning -> Regression), and a "Train Model" module (Machine Learning-> Train). Connect the "Neural Network Regression" module to the left input of the "Train Model" module, and your training data set into the right output of the "Train Model" module. Then configure then modules as follows:

"Neural Network Regression" module:
* Trainer Mode: Single Parameter
* Hidden Layer: Fully-connected
* Hidden Nodes: 100
* Learning Rate: 0.005
* Learning Iterations: 10 (this is very low, but we want to process our data quickly - if we don't get good results, we can increase this)
* Initial Weights: 0.1
* Momentum: 0.001
* Type: Min-Max
* Shuffle Examples: checked  (Note: this should make our previous "Split Data" shuffle unnecessary. This was a newly released feature during the development of this lab, and did not always appear to shuffle fully during testing)
* Random number seed: Type in any number you choose

For the "Train Model" module, choose "Duration Days" as the column to train against, as this is what we're trying to predict.

    ![Model](media/100/ml2_nn.png)

### Training the Model

Let's have another checkpoint to see how out model performs. Run your experiment. While the "Train Model" module is executing, you can watch its progress by clicking on "View output log". The most interesting data here is the "MeanErr" (actually the squared mean error), which is a gauge of how good the model is performing against the training data (which hopefully will replicate against the evaluation sample). In the case below, after 3 (out of 10) iterations, our squared error is extremely low: the square root of 2.16 is ~1.47, which means the model thinks is accurate to a day and a half against the training set, which indicates we're on the right track. Let the training complete.

    ![Model Training Progress](media/100/ml2_trainprogress.png)

### Use our Model to score our Evaluation Data

Let's see how our model performed by using it against the evaluation sample. "Scoring" a dataset is a Machine Learning term that leverages a model against a dataset, adding the model's predictions as a new column.  Drag in a new "Score Model" module (Machine Learning -> Score), and connect the output of the "Train Model" module to its left input, and the evaluation sample (the right output of the "Split Months" module from a few steps back) to the right input. Ensure that it is configured to "append the score column", as we'll want to compare the model's predictions to our known durations in the evaluation data. Drag in an "Evaluate Model" module (Machine Learning-> Evaluate) and connect the output of "Score Model" to its left input. Run the experiment again.  Note: Machine Learning Studio is fairly intelligent, and will not rerun steps if the parameters/inputs into that step have not changed. Therefore, we can train our model now, and add more steps to our experiment later without having to re-execute the lengthy "Train Model" steps as long as we don't alter any of its inputs or parameters.

    ![Score & Evaluate Model](media/100/ml2_finalconfig.png)

### Assess our Model's performance ###

1. Let's see how our model did against the evaluation sample. Visualize the output of the Evaluate Model module. Against my model, I got a "Mean Absolute Error" of 1.43 days, and almost all predictions were closer than 4 days.

    ![Evaluation Results](media/25/ml2_evaluateresults1.png) 

1. Overall, it seems like we have a very effective model. Let's eyeball the actual predictions. Visualize the output of the "Score Model" module and compare the "Duration Days" (which is our known duration) to the "Scored Label" column (our model's predictions). Compare the histograms - they have a similar shape, which is what we want. Look at a few rows of the data - the predictions should pretty accurate as well. The model performed very well on our evaluation sample, giving us good reason to believe that we have not over-trained against the sample data, and we can use it in our production system.

    ![Evaluation Results 2](media/100/ml2_evaluateresults2.png)

1. Save your experiment using the bottom toolbar with a name such as DevCampML_CPL

----

## Exercise 3. Publish our Model as a Web Service

### Set Up the Prediction Web Service pipeline

Click on "Set up a Web Service" -> Predictive Web Service in the bottom toolbar. If this option is disabled, rerun your model (which should be quick as Machine Learning Studio remembers partial progress). In a new tab, new modules will be added to a copy of your experiment, and the data flow changed.

    ![Predictive Web Service](media/50/ml3_predictive.png)

### 2. Execute the Prediction Web Service

1. Click "Run" in the bottom toolbar to run this web service creation pipeline

### Deploy

1. Deploy the web service using the bottom toolbar. Use the "New" web service deployment option. Select the storage account and price plan (created in Exercise 1).

1. Click "Deploy".

    ![Predictive Web Service Config](media/100/ml3_webserviceconfig.png)

### Test the Predictive Web Service

 On the next screen, click on `Test Web Service`. Fill in realistic sample data, such as:

* Complaint Type: Pot hole
* Created Date: Today's date
* Descriptor: Pothole - highway
* Incident Zip: 10302
* Address Type: ADDRESS
* City: STATEN ISLAND
* Status: Closed
* Community Board: 01 STATEN ISLAND
* Borough: STATEN ISLAND
* Latitude: 40.6
* Longitude -74.17
* Created Month, etc: calculate using to match what you used for Created Date above
* Duration_Days: 0 (this is ignored).

1. Click on "Test Request-Response"
  
    ![Web Service Prediction](media/100/ml3_prediction.png)

1. Try altering values (keep them in line with the sample data) and observe the changes in the "Scored Labels" (prediction) value.

1. When you are ready to proceed, click on `Consume` in the top menu. This will provide the endpoint URI, keys, and even C# sample code. Leave this browser window open - we'll steal the sample code in the next exercise.

    ![Web Service Consume](media/50/ml3_consume.png)

----

## Exercise 4: Use a Trained Data Model in an Application

In this exercise, we will alter the notification emails sent to incident reporters following creation of an incident to include our model's prediction of how long we thing it will take to resolve the issue.  We will assume that you have completed HOL13 - Azure Functions, which moved the mail functionality from the IncidentController to an Azure Function. However, the code that we will be writing here could easily be integrated into the IncidentController if you did not complete HOL13.

### Open your Azure Function

1. Open your e-mail logic in a separate browser window - this should be the Azure Function you created in HOL13. You can find it via the Azure Portal, under the DevCamp resource group as a "Function App".

    ![Web Service Consume](media/100/ml4_afstartingcode.png)

1. While most of the assemblies we need are already included in Azure Function's default configuration, the authentication for our web service will require that we include System.Net.Http.Headers. Add the following statement to the top of your codebase:

```csharp
    using System.Net.Http.Headers;
```

### 2. Insert Sample Code

1. Copy the InvokeRequestResponseService method from the Azure Machine Learning Studio Web Service consumption tab left open at the end of Exercise 3 into your Azure Function. Rename the method something more appropriate, such as `InvokePredictionService`

```csharp
        static async Task InvokePredictionService() // Originally InvokeRequestResponseService
                {
                    using (var client = new HttpClient())
                    {
                        var scoreRequest = new
                        {
                            Inputs = new Dictionary<string, List<Dictionary<string, string>>> () {
                                {
                                    "input1",
                                    new List<Dictionary<string, string>>(){new Dictionary<string, string>(){
                                                    {
                                                        "Complaint Type", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Created Date", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Descriptor", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Incident Zip", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Address Type", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "City", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Status", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Community Board", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Borough", ""
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Latitude", "1"
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Longitude", "1"
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Created Year", "1"
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Created Month", "1"
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                        "Created Day of Month", "1"

                                                    },
                                                    {

                                                    {
                                                        "Duration_Days", "1"
                                                    },

                                    }
                                },

                            GlobalParameters = new Dictionary<string, string>() {
                            }
                        };

                        const string apiKey = "[YOUR API KEY]"; // Replace this with the API key for the web service
                        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue( "Bearer", apiKey);
                        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("[YOUR ML URL]");

                        // WARNING: The 'await' statement below can result in a deadlock

                            string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                            Console.WriteLine(responseContent);
                        }
                    }
                }
```

### 3. Integrate With Our CosmosDB Data

To make this interesting, we will want to populate as many of the input values for our prediction web service as possible. Unfortunately, since City, Power, and Lights uses a slightly different schema than our New York data, we will have to hard-code some values. 

* Azure Functions don't have a console, so change all:

```csharp
        Console.WriteLine
            to  
        log.Info
```

* Alter the function prototype so we can pass in information about the current Document being processed, and a reference to our log writer. Change the task return type so we can return an int (our prediction)

```csharp
        static async Task<int> InvokePredictionService(string curDocType,
                                                DateTime curDocDate,
                                                string curDocDescription,
                                                string curDocZip,
                                                string curDocCity,
                                                TraceWriter log)  
```

* Populate the input structure

```csharp
                    new List<Dictionary<string, string>>(){new Dictionary<string, string>(){
                                    {
                                        "Complaint Type", curDocType
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created Date", curDocDate.ToString("MM/dd/YYYY")
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Descriptor", curDocDescription
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Incident Zip", curDocZip
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Address Type", "ADDRESS" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "City", curDocCity
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Status", "Closed" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Community Board", "STATEN ISLAND" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Borough", "01 STATEN ISLAND" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Latitude", "40.6" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app. Could use Bing's geolocating API
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Longitude", "-74.17" // Have to hard-code this, as it is not in CPL's app. Could use Bing's geolocating API
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created Year", curDocDate.ToString("YYYY")
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created Month", curDocDate.ToString("MM")
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created Day of Month", curDocDate.ToString("dd")
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created Day of Week", curDocDate.DayOfWeek.ToString()
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Created WeekNum", Math.Floor(curDocDate.DayOfYear/7.0f).ToString() // Cheap, non-global friendly calendaring
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "Duration_Days", "0" // This is ignored by the model
                                    },
                        }
                    }
```

* Populate the API key with the value from your Machine Learning Studio Web Service Consume tab. You can either put this directly in your code, or use the mechanism shown in HOL13 to place the key in an AppSetting.
  
![Web Service Keys](media/100/ml4_mlkeys.png)

Include your API Key in the code at the following line:

```csharp
        const string apiKey = "[YOUR API KEY]"; // Replace this with the API key for the web service
```

### 4. Parse the results

The sample data returns the results as JSON, which we'll need to parse to obtain the prediction. 
* Add a reference to the Newtonsoft assembly at the top of your code

```csharp
        #r "Newtonsoft.Json"
```

* Add a using statement for Newtonsoft as well. We'll be using the deserializer which is part of Newtonsoft's Linq.

```csharp
        using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
```

* Alter the "successful web service" code path as follows: (note the change in the log.Info("Result: " + result) line to avoid using String.Format)

```csharp
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            log.Info("Result: " + result);
            JObject resultObj = JObject.Parse(result);
            double rawPrediction = Convert.ToDouble(resultObj.SelectToken("Results.output1[0].['Scored Labels']"));
            log.Info("Prediction: " + rawPrediction.ToString());
            int prediction = Convert.ToInt32(rawPrediction) + 3; // Let's give us a safety margin for our prediction - add 3 days
            return(prediction);

        }
```

* Add an error value to the "unsuccessful web service" code path. For this exercise, we'll just return a big number - in reality, we would want to handle this error appropriately.

```csharp
        return(1000);

        else
                {
                    log.Info(string.Format("The request failed with status code: {0}", response.StatusCode));

                    // Print the headers - they include the request ID and the timestamp,
                    // which are useful for debugging the failure
                    log.Info(response.Headers.ToString());

                    string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                    log.Info(responseContent);
                    return(1000);
                }
```

### 5. Use the results

1. Let's actually call our prediction function. Add the following lines of code underneath where we parsed the CosmosDB document into variables:

```csharp
    DateTime curDocCreated  = input[curDocNum].GetPropertyValue<DateTime>("Created");
    
    log.Info("Ready to obtain prediction:");
    int prediction = InvokePredictionService( curDocType,
                                curDocCreated,
                                curDocDescription,
                                curDocZip,
                                curDocCity,  log ).Result;

    DateTime resolvedPredictionDate = curDocCreated.AddDays(prediction);
    log.Info("Got prediction:");
```

1. Finally, let's use these results in our email. Add this line to email template, and make sure to pass in the resolvedPredictionDate variable that now contains our prediction.

```
    Our best estimate for this being resolved is: {9}
```

1. Your email template should look like:

```csharp
        string mailBody  = String.Format(@"We have received your incident report: 
                                                            Type: {0}

                                                            Reported on: {8}
                                                            
                                                            
                                                            Our best estimate for this being resolved is: {9}.  
                                                            We will provide updates as progress is made.

                                                            Thank you,
                                                            City, Power, and Lights
                                                            ", curDocType, curDocDescription, curDocStreet, curDocCity, curDocState, curDocZip, curDocFirstName, curDocLastName, curDocCreated.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy"), resolvedPredictionDate.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy"));
```

### 6. Test everything together

Save your code, and trigger an execution by altering a CosmosDB record or creating a new record via the CPL application. Watch the logs of your Azure Function to ensure it progresses correctly. Check your email (including your junk folder) to watch for the resulting email! It should include our estimated fix date. Congratulations on adding Machine Intelligence to City, Power, and Lights!

Your final code should look like:

## Optional extensions

1. Rerun the model to see if you can get more accurate results. Try increasing the number of iterations and the number of hidden nodes
1. Use an online source of data using the Import data tool
1. Use R to clean the data, or expand new features. As an example, remove the "Year","Month","DayofMonth","DayofWeek" columns from the dataset, and create them within Machine Learning Studio. This also results in a cleaner web service. 
1. Experiment with data cleansing tools such as "Clip Values" (Data Transformation -> Scale & Reduce) 
1. Clone the exercise and rerun it without the "randomizing step" and without "Shuffle" in the "Train Model" module, and compare the quality of the resulting model. Take a look into the "output log"s of the training and compare how quickly and effectively the "MeanError" diminishes with each iteration.  
1. Use the Bing REST API to geocode your address in the CPL app, and make sure the incident being reported has a valid address. Leverage the geocoding functionality to obtain the Latitude/Longitude and store that in the CosmosDB record, then use that instead of our hard-coded value in the input for the predictive model web service.  See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701714.aspx for more details.

## HOL Notes

1. If you take a break in the middle of the exercise and need to re-find your Machine Learning Studio Web Services, these can be in an unintuitive location. Browse to https://studio.azureml.net, and click on "Web Services" in the left toolbar. However, your web service likely does not show up in this screen, as we did not create it in classic mode. Therefore, look for the "If you don't see your web service, try here" link in the top right of your screen. Your Web Services should be accessible from the new interface.
