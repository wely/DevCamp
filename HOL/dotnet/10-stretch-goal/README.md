# Stretch Goal (.NET)

## Overview
City Power & Light is a sample application that allows citizens to report "incidents" that have occurred in their community. It includes a landing screen, a dashboard, and a form for reporting new incidents with an optional photo. The application is implemented with several components:

* Front end web application contains the user interface and business logic. This component has been implemented three times in .NET, NodeJS, and Java.
* WebAPI is shared across the front ends and exposes the backend DocumentDB.
* DocumentDB is used as the data persistence layer.

This lab represents an optional stretch goal exercise where you add an additional feature to the City Power & Light sample application on your own.

## Objectives
In this hands-on lab, you will be using the knowledge gained in [HOL 3](../03-azuread-office365) and learn about some additional Microsoft Graph features. 

## Prerequisites
* Completion of the [HOL 3](../03-azuread-office365).
* A sample solution for this stretch goal is located in the [sample](sample) folder. 

## Exercises
This hands-on-lab has the following exercises:
* [Exercise 1: Create an event](#ex1)

## Exercise 1: Create an event<a name="ex1"></a>

In [HOL 3](../03-azuread-office365) you learned about Microsoft Graph and used it to send an email when a new incident has been reported. In this stretch goal you will extend your code to also schedule a meeting for an incident. Your work comprises these tasks:

When an incident is reported: 
* Use Microsoft Graph to read all the current user's contacts.
* Create a new calendar event.
* The event should be scheduled during regular working hours and at least one day in the future.
* As attendees include 3 entries from the user's contact list.
* As body include the details of the incident.

## Hints
* Read these articles on [List contacts](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/user_list_contacts) and [Create Event](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/user_post_events) from the Microsoft Graph API before you start.
* If you have created a new account to work on the hands-on labs add some sample contacts in [Outlook](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/). Note that real invitations will be send to these contacts when you run your code! If you use your real account analyze the response from the `Contacts` API to pick some contacts that you can send test invitations to.
* Add Microsoft Graph Permissions for your app to read contacts, read and write the calendar at [https://apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com).
* In the `settings.cs` add new constants for Graph URLs to contacts and to events.
* In the `Models` folder create new classes for `Event` to store the values send to the Graph API (similar in use to `Models` -> `MailMessage.cs`) and for `Contact` to deserialize the received data (similar in use to `ViewModels` -> `UserProfileViewModel.cs`). Note that you can use the existing `Body` and `EmailAddress` classes from the `MailMessage` class for your `Event` class and that one class is enough to handle `start` and `end`.
* A response from the `Contacts` API contains more properties than listed in the article above. You will just need the (not listed) `emailAddresses` part. Use the debugger to analyze a response.
* Note that the contacts are contained in an array called `value` that you have to deserialize, too.
* Call your new code in the `Controllers` -> `IncidentController.cs` after `SendIncidentEmail` call in the `Create` method to execute it when a new incident has been reported.

## Summary

In this hands-on lab, you learned about some additional Microsoft Graph features and created your own code to extend the City Power & Light sample application.
