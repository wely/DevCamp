## Exercise 2: Connect and prepare the data <a name="ex2"></a>

1. We will need to load some incidents so our report can have some data. In a browser, navigate to `http://incidentapi[YOUR API ID]].azurewebsites.net/incidents/fakedata`. You will see a message similar to the following that indicates success:

```JSON
    {
    "Version": {
        "_Major": 1,
        "_Minor": 1,
        "_Build": -1,
        "_Revision": -1
    },
    "Content": {
        "Message": "Initialized fake data with [486] incidents",
        "Id": "780f8505-20c2-4a7a-8904-e8ec728b1a7f",
        "Timestamp": "2017-10-04T21:52:09.1253208Z",

            ]
        }
        ]
    },
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ReasonPhrase": "OK",
    "Headers": [],
    "RequestMessage": null,
    "IsSuccessStatusCode": true
    }
```
1. Launch the Power BI desktop tool and select `Open other reports`
