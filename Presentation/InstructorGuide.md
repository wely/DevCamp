# DevCamp
These guide will help instructors when delivering this course. There are some speaker notes in each deck, but this will provide a broader view of how the course was put together.

The Developer bootcamp is a collection of lectures, content and hands on labs that is intended to provide developers with a jumpstart to Azure development. There is an emphasis on the Platform as a Services (PAAS) offerings in Azure but there are some IaaS related topics as well.

The concept of "1-app, 3 ways" was born from the idea that developers want to see the whole picture, not just pieces. In previous training courses, they are focused on individual modules and learning objectives. For this bootcamp, we took the approach of a single application and functionality is added over the 2 days (Develop, deploy, monitor, scale). We also realized that developers may want to see the same functionality developed in different languages, so they can compare and contrast approaches.

The application is very simple; a CRUD based form with as few moving parts as possible, all while being industry/vertical agnostic. The application can be re-imagined in several ways with minimal impact to the session content and HOLs.
* Education - A science fair idea board
* Manufacturing - Process improvement
* E-Commerce - Item review/feedback
