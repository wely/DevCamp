## Exercise 2: Connect and prepare the data <a name="ex2"></a>

1. We will need to load some incidents so our report can have some data. In a browser, navigate to `http://incidentapi[YOUR API ID]].azurewebsites.net/incidents/fakedata`. You will see a message similar to the following that indicates success:

```JSON
    {
    "Version": {
        "_Major": 1,
        "_Minor": 1,
        "_Build": -1,
        "_Revision": -1
    },
    "Content": {
        "Message": "Initialized fake data with [486] incidents",
        "Id": "780f8505-20c2-4a7a-8904-e8ec728b1a7f",
        "Timestamp": "2017-10-04T21:52:09.1253208Z",
        "Headers": [
        {
            "Key": "Content-Type",
            "Value": [
            "application/json; charset=utf-8"
            ]
        }
        ]
    },
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ReasonPhrase": "OK",
    "Headers": [],
    "RequestMessage": null,
    "IsSuccessStatusCode": true
    }
```
1. Launch the Power BI desktop tool and select `Open other reports`

    ![image](./media/pbi-launch.png)

1. Navigate to the HOL 6, Start folder and choose the `Outage Dashboard`

    ![image](./media/pbi-opendashboard.png)

1. Once the dashboard is open, you will see that the visuals are broken. We will get data from your Cosmos DB Database.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-01.png)

1. From the menu, choose `Get Data > More`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-02.png)

1. On the Get Data screen, choose `Azure > Azure CosomosDB`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-03.png)

1. You may get a prompt stating that the conntector is in preview. Click `Continue`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-04.png)

1. In Azure, gather the connection information for your CosmosDB. You will need the URL and the key.
    
    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-05.png)

1. In the Power BI connection screen, enter your URL

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-06.png)

1. Entet the key and click `Connect`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-07.png)

1. Power BI will connect to your data and discover the data. Select the `Incidents` collection and then click `Load`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-08.png)

1. You may recieve a prompt that notifies you of pending changes. Click `Apply Changes` to accept the updates

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-09.png)

1. From the side navigation menu, click the `Table` icon

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-10.png)

1. Now that we have our data, we neeed to configure the data source to transform the fields for display on the report. On the right side of the screen, in the Incidents table definition, click the `...` and choose `Edit Query`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-11.png)

1. Find the `Document` table header and click on the `Expand` icon. This will display the following screen. Uncheck the `Use original column as prefix` option and click `Ok`

1. On the right side you will see a list of transformations that were applied to datasource so far.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-13.png)

1. Click `Close and apply` to go back to the report.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-14.png)

1. Notice that the report now shows some visualizations.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-15.png)

1. Edit the query again and let's transform some of the fields for the report. Select the `Created` column

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-16.png)

1. From the menu click on `Transform`. Choose `Data type > Date/time` and `Date/Time`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-17.png)

1. Apply the same transform to the `LastModified` column

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-18.png)

1. Now let's add a new column to the datasource that calculates the number of days a incident is open. From the modeling menu, choose `New Column`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-20.png)

1. Enter the following formula in the custom query window

    ```Excel
    DaysOpen = if(incidents[Created] = TODAY(), 0, DateDiff(incidents[Created], Today(), DAY))
    ```

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-21.png)

1. Close and apply the changes to the query and go back to the report.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-22.png)

1. Now, let's change some of the visualizations. Select the Map visualization.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-23.png)

1. On the formatting options, find the `Title Text` field. Change the name to `Top 10 Zip Codes`

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-24.png)

1. Chose the `Average Of Days Open` visualization card.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-25.png)

1. From the formatting options, change the visual to a status bar. Add `Days Open` column to the `Value`, `Minimum Value` and `Maximun Value`. Confiure the display type to match the value.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-26.png)

1. Your report should be udpated with the new visualizations.

    ![image](./media/pbi-dashboard-27.png)

You are now ready to publish your data.
